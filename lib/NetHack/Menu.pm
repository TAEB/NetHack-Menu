=head1 NAME

NetHack::Menu - interact with NetHack's menus

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.05 released ???

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.05';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use NetHack::Menu;
    my $menu = NetHack::Menu->new(vt => $term_vt102);

    # compile all pages of the menu
    until ($menu->at_end) {
        $term_vt102->process($nh->send_and_recv($menu->next));
    }

    # we want to stuff all blessed items into our bag
    $menu->select(sub { /blessed/ });

    # but we don't want things that will make our bag explode
    $menu->deselect(sub { /cancell|bag.*(holding|tricks)/ });

    $term_vt102->process($nh->send_and_recv($menu->commit));

=head1 DESCRIPTION

NetHack requires a lot of menu management. This module aims to alleviate the
difficulty of parsing and interacting with menus.

This module is meant to be as general and flexible as possible. You just give
it a L<Term::VT102> object, send the commands it gives you to NetHack, and
update the L<Term::VT102> object. Your code should look roughly the same as
the code given in the Synopsis.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new (vt => L<Term::VT102>, select_count => (none|single|multi)) -> C<NetHack::Menu>

Takes a L<Term::VT102> (or a behaving subclass, such as
L<Term::VT102::Boundless> or L<Term::VT102::ZeroBased>). Also takes an optional
C<select_count> which determines the type of menu. C<NetHack::Menu> cannot
intuit it by itself, it depends on the application to know what it is dealing
with. Default: C<multi>.

=head2 select_count [none|single|multi] -> (none|single|multi)

Accessor for C<select_count>. Default: C<multi>.

=head2 has_menu -> Bool

Is there currently a menu on the screen?

=head2 at_end -> Bool

This will return whether we've finished compiling the menu. This must be
called for each page because this is what does all the compilation.

Note that if there's no menu, this will C<croak>.

=head2 next -> Str

Returns the string to be used to get to the next page. Note that you should
not ignore this method and use C<< > >> or a space if your menu may not
start on page 1. This method will make sure everything is hunky-dory anyway,
so you should still use it.

=head2 select Code

Evaluates the code for each item on the menu and selects those which produce
a true value. The code ref receives C<$_> as the text of the item (e.g.
C<a blessed +1 quarterstaff (weapon in hands)>). The code ref also receives the
item's selector (the character you'd type to toggle the item) as an argument.

Note that you can stack up multiple selects (and deselects) before eventually
finishing the menu with C<< $menu->commit >>.

Do note that selecting is not the same as toggling.

This currently returns no useful value.

=head2 deselect Code

Same as select, but different in the expected way. C<:)>

=head2 commit -> Str

This will return the string to be sent that will navigate the menu and toggle
the requested items.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item

Not everyone uses the default C<^>, C<|>, and C<< > >> menu accelerators.
Provide a way to change them.

=item

Not everyone uses L<Term::VT102>. Provide some way to pass in just a string or
something. This will be added on an if-needed basis. Anyone?
